# Travis build sequencer

Limit `push` builds in Travis to one per branch.

Useful in cases where builds perform deployments that would otherwise interfere.

## Usage

1. Get a Travis API token -- probably for a bot user -- and set the `TRAVIS_TOKEN` environment variable for the repository.

2. Set `TRAVIS_ENDPOINT` to `https://api.travis-ci.org` or `https://api.travis-ci.com` for public or private repositories, respectively.

3. Set `ONEBUILD_BRANCHES` to a comma-separated list of branches like `master,staging,production`. If left unset, `onebuild` will restrict *all* branches to one `push` build each.

4. Add to `.travis.yml`:

    ```yaml
    language: go

    before_install:
    # Get the tool
    - git clone git@github.com:pulumi/onebuild ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/pulumi/onebuild
    - go install github.com/pulumi/onebuild
    # Proceed or cancel this build
    - onebuild start

    after_script:
    # Maybe kick off a waiting build
    - onebuild finish
    ```

## Goals and approach

### One build at a time

When a build starts, it checks if it is the running (i.e. `started`) build with the earliest `started_at` time. If so, it proceeds. Otherwise, it exits by cancelling itself.

When a build observes itself to be first by this ordering, it will remain first until it exits -- and it will _always_ have been first from the perspective of any other running build. This lets us use "earliest-started running build" as a simple and stable master-election strategy.

> _TODO_: What if two builds report exactly the same start time?

### Newest build will eventually run

When a running build finishes (successfully or not), it looks at the most recently queued build (i.e. highest `ID`, since Travis assigns monotonically-increasing `ID`s) and restarts it if its state is `canceled`. Intervening builds are skipped for efficiency.

It is possible for a build to cancel itself at exactly the wrong moment: before the build it's waiting for has finished, but _after_ that build has looked for -- and not found -- a `canceled` build to restart.

The next queued build will run without incident, so this should only be a brief problem for active repositories. The `canceled` build can also be manually restarted. If we end up hitting this problem often, we can consider waiting for the newest build to _become_ `canceled` (as it must) so we can restart it.

### Builds run in queued order

Even if we're sure only one build can run at a time, it's conceivable that an older build will be delayed long enough for a newer build to run and finish. Since we use the Travis API to restart builds, there's also the possibility of a bug where we improperly restart an old build.

In order to prevent older builds from racing past newer ones, each build checks that it has a **higher `ID`** than any finished (`passed`, `failed`, or `errored`) build.

This still allows the most recently finished build to be restarted.
